- Implements PBKDF2 for key derivation
- Secure random salt generation
- Authenticated encryption using GCM

### Password Generation
- Configurable password length
- Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers and special characters
- Ensures strong password creation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kartik-Kh/Secure-Password-Manager.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Secure-Password-Manager
```

3. Compile the project:
```bash
javac -d target/classes -cp "lib/*" src/main/java/com/ibm/securepm/*/*.java src/main/java/com/ibm/securepm/*.java
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
java -cp "target/classes;lib/*" com.ibm.securepm.ui.PasswordManagerGUI
```

## Usage

1. **First Launch**
   - Enter your master password when prompted
   - This password will be used to encrypt/decrypt your stored passwords
   - Remember this password as it cannot be recovered

2. **Adding Passwords**
   - Click "Add Password"
   - Fill in the details (title, username, password, URL, notes)
   - Use the "Generate Password" button for strong passwords
   - Click "OK" to save

3. **Viewing Passwords**
   - Select a password entry
   - Click "View Password"
   - Use the "Show Password" checkbox to reveal the password

4. **Searching**
   - Use the search bar to filter entries
   - Searches through titles, usernames, and URLs

5. **Deleting Passwords**
   - Select a password entry
   - Click "Delete Password"
   - Confirm deletion

## Best Practices

1. Choose a strong master password
2. Regularly backup your database file
3. Use generated passwords when possible
4. Never share your master password
5. Keep your Java runtime updated
